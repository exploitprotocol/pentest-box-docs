Restaring Tab as Admin
--------------------------

By default PentestBox runs like an normal user, no administratore permission is required to launch it.  But when you will be operating it then some tools might need administrative permission. In that case you need to right click on tab and choose restart as admin , after this that tab will be given administrative rights.

PentestBox KeyBoard Shortcuts
------------------------------------

* CTRL + T : To open new tab
* CTRL + C : To close the script/program running.
* If opened multiple Tabs then you can access them using "SHIFT+ ALT +number" , number is the value for the tab . For example, number will be 1 for first tab and 2 for second tab and so on.
* CTRL + w : This will close your current active console.
* ALT +Enter : Pentestbox will go FullScreen.

Update Feature
---------------------------------

Maintaining a product is always much more important than actually making one. That is why to keep all the tools updated inside PentestBox we have included a update utility. Also i have added update config which will be used as a medium to fix the bugs if any comes up and update tools to include a new tool in coming future through our github repo. 
You would see something similar if you would type update on console.
